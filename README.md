# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Summary

Here is my back-end refactoring for the Express.js Note Taker

To use the Note Taker run 
npm i
npm run start

The server will be available on localhost3001
From here you can type in the note title and body. Once the body has some text you will be able to save the note and by clicking the plus sign will allow you to take another note.
